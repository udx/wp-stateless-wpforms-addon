# WP-Stateless - WPForms Addon

Provides compatibility between the [WPForms](https://wpforms.com/) (or [WPForms Lite](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpforms-lite/)) and the [WP-Stateless](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-stateless/) plugins.

### Features

* Disables filename randomization for WPForms Builder in Admin Panel.

### Notes

* Tested with WPForms plugin version 1.9.1.3
* The _File Upload_ field with a _Modern_ style is not compatible with _Stateless_ mode. Change the WPForms field style to _Classic_ or use another WP-Stateless mode with the _Modern_ field style.
